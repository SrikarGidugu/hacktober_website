What is considered a valid pull request?


ANSWER
A valid pull request is one that is accepted by the maintainer of the project you submit it to.

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, 
or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. 
The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.


Note: 

A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
